# ThreadsVsProcesses

The objective here was to obtain a measure of efficiency and performance of threads versus processes.
The program performs a system intensive operation to see how the workers handle the increased load.
The mathematical operation consisted of hashing a randomly generated string (length = 100 characters) at iterations of 1000,2000, 2500, and 5000. The program also uses file I/O to add to the load of the intensive task.
